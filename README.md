# Sample Airbnb Listings – Static JavaScript Project

A lightweight, front‑end–only demo that showcases sample Airbnb‑style property listings using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project is ideal for learning how to structure static data, render dynamic UI elements, and simulate a simple listings interface without a backend.

## 🚀 Features

- Static dataset of sample Airbnb listings
- Dynamic rendering of listing cards using vanilla JavaScript
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile
- Filter‑ready architecture for future enhancements
- Zero dependencies — runs in any modern browser

## 📁 Project Structure
/project-root
│── index.html         # Main entry point
│── styles.css         # Basic styling for layout and cards
│── data.js            # Static sample listings
│── app.js             # Rendering logic and DOM manipulation
└── assets/           # Images or icons (optional)


## 🧠 How It Works

- `data.js` contains an array of listing objects (title, price, rating, image, etc.).
- `app.js` loads the data and dynamically generates HTML elements.
- Listings are inserted into the page on load.
- No frameworks, build tools, or servers required.

## ▶️ Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install Reload or HTTP-Server via npm or your package manager of choice.
3. Navigate to the repository folder and run the http-server.
4. Open up the webpage at the local host specified.
5. Navigate the website!

## 🛠 Customization

You can extend the project by:

- Adding filters (price, location, amenities)
- Integrating a real API
- Enhancing the UI with animations or layout improvements
- Replacing sample data with your own listings
